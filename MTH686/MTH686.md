## Model Descriptions and Analysis

The project evaluates three different models based on their fit to the observed data ($y_{obs}$). Each model has its own functional form and associated plots and code. The common dataset `t` and `y_obs` is used across all models.

### Model 1: Exponential Model

* **Model Equation**: $y(t) = a_0 + a_1 e^{b_1 t} + a_2 e^{b_2 t}$
* **Parameters**:
    * $a_0 = 2.4947456317066132$
    * $a_1 = -4.614746605158952$
    * $a_2 = 0.00292974233111956$
    * $b_1 = -1.3475358281633416$
    * $b_2 = 3.154774060104342$
* **Residuals Plot**:     * The residuals for Model 1 appear to be **randomly scattered around zero**, suggesting that this model provides a reasonably good fit to the data. This indicates that the model captures the underlying trend well, and the errors are likely random noise.
* **Estimated $\sigma^2$**: $0.001602$
    * This value represents the estimated variance of the residuals.
* **$y(t)$ vs $t$ Plot**:     * The plot of $y(t)$ against $t$ for Model 1 shows how the model's predictions align with the time variable.

### Model 2: Rational Function Model

* **Model Equation**: $y(t) = \frac{a_0 + a_1 t}{b_0 + b_1 t}$
* **Parameters**:
    * $a_0 = -7.769768988643991$
    * $a_1 = -4.144543052379127$
    * $b_0 = -0.9776519028585906$
    * $b_1 = 0.5030137032683771$
* **Residuals Plot**:     * The residuals for Model 2 show a **distinct parabolic or curved trend**. This indicates a **systematic error** and suggests that Model 2 is **not an appropriate fit** for the observed data, as it fails to capture the underlying non-linear relationship.
* **$y(t)$ vs $t$ Plot**:     * This plot shows the predicted $y(t)$ values from Model 2 over time.

### Model 3: Polynomial Model

* **Model Equation**: $y(t) = b_0 + b_1 t + b_2 t^2 + b_3 t^3 + b_4 t^4$
* **Parameters**:
    * $b_0 = -2.11602973$
    * $b_1 = 6.020230054$
    * $b_2 = -4.02079592$
    * $b_3 = 1.52802786$
    * $b_4 = -0.22932868$
* **Residuals Plot**:     * The residuals for Model 3 exhibit a **clear trend, increasing with time**. This systematic pattern indicates that the model is **biased** and does not adequately fit the data. The model consistently underestimates the observed values as time progresses.
* **$y(t)$ vs $t$ Plot**:     * The plot of $y(t)$ against $t$ for Model 3 illustrates the model's predictions over the given time range.
